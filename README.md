# Dog-Vision-MultiClassification-Project
# 🐶End-To-End MultiClass Dog Breed Identification

this Notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensolrFlow 2.0 and Tensorflow Hub.

## 1. Problem

## 4. Features

Some Information about the Data:
* We're dealing with images (unstructured Data) so its probably best to use Deep learning /Transfer Learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
* There are around 10K images in Trainng set (These Images have Labels).
* There are around 10k images in Test set (These Images don't have labels).
